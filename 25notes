1) plotting artifacts found (northing and easting), and the age of the artifact, seeing how many groups came through. use frequency vs time, fourier transform, elevation vs number of artifacts 

2) more complicated cookie problem, selling different things, time to do things with an arbitrary about of time and money, like planning a vacation, can only buy/do things once 
- max money 
- price 
- how much for each day
- how long the vacation is 
- cannot repeat anything 
- how much money is left 

3) somehow use the laplace 

4) matrix ?

5) spline interpolation

- talked to Alexina about number one, brought up problem of not solving a phgysics problem, more independent of this project.
